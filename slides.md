# Drone Safety Rules Review

## 10:15 - 10:25

* Fly indoors only
* Stay below 10 feet
* Clear obstacles
* Be aware of connectivity issues (people = water)
* Pre-flight checks: environment, drone, firmware, controller
* Emergency stop procedures

---

# Pre-Flight Checklist (Part 1)

**Directions: The mechanic leads the Pre-Flight Checklist with a call-and-response activity. Say each checklist item. Pilot responds with:**

✅ "CHECK!" if completed
❌ "NEED TO FIX!" if not ready

### 1 Environment Check

* Is the flight area clear of obstacles, fragile items, liquids, and other people?  — CHECK!

### 2 Drone Hardware Check

* "Propellers clean & undamaged?" — CHECK!
* "Motors OK?" — CHECK!
* "Drone labeled & paired?" — CHECK!
* "Firmware updated?" — CHECK!

---

# Pre-Flight Checklist (Part 2)

### 3 Battery Check

* "Battery fully charged & inserted?" — CHECK!
* "Spare batteries are charged and ready?" — CHECK!
* "Controller batteries are above 20%?" — CHECK!

### 4 Flight Readiness

* "Know Emergency Stop?" — CHECK!
* "Know drone front?" — CHECK!
* "Test Takeoff + Hover + Land done?" — CHECK!

**Final call:** Are you READY TO FLY SAFELY? — READY!
